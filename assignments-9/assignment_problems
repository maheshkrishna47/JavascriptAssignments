1. Carefully observe this example.
a) Is the InnerFunction() a closure?
b) What is output of this program

function OuterFunction()
{ var outerVariable = 100;
function InnerFunction() {
alert(outerVariable);
}
return InnerFunction;
}
var innerFunc = OuterFunction();
innerFunc();

2. What is the difference between a closure and a scope ?
3. What is a lexical scope and how is it related to closure?
4. Output of following closure ?
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
setTimeout(function log() {
console.log(i); // What is logged?
}, 1000);
}
